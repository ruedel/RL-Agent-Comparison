# Reinforcement Learning Agent Comparison

This project involves training a reinforcement learning agent using two different algorithms: DQN and PPO. The agent is trained in the Highway-v0 environment provided by the Farama Foundation. The goal is to compare the performance of these three algorithms in the context of autonomous driving.

## Installation

To install the necessary libraries, you can use the provided `requirements.txt` file:


## Usage

To run the project, open the Jupyter notebook `RL Agent Comparison.ipynb` and execute the cells in order.

## Project Structure

- `RL Agent Comparison.ipynb`: This Jupyter notebook contains all the code for training and evaluating the reinforcement learning agents.
- `requirements.txt`: This file lists the Python libraries that are required to run the project.
- `README.md`: This file provides an overview of the project and instructions for installing and using it.
- `content`: This folder contains the training logs, the cloned highway-env and videos of the first 30 training episodes of the DQN agent.

## Algorithms

The project uses the following reinforcement learning algorithms:

- **DQN**: Deep Q-Network is a model-free, online, off-policy reinforcement learning method.
- **PPO**: Proximal Policy Optimization is a policy gradient method for reinforcement learning.

## Environment

The agents are trained in the Highway-v0 environment provided by the Farama Foundation.

## Performance Evaluation

The performance of the agents is evaluated by visualizing the training process and testing the agents in the environment.
